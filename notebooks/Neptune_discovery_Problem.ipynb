    "## **The Amazing Story Behind Neptune's Discovery**\n\n",
    "Imagine you're watching a friend walk in a straight line, but suddenly they start wobbling slightly. You can't see what's causing it, but you suspect someone invisible is gently pushing them. This is exactly what happened with the planet Uranus in the 1800s!\n\n",
    "### **What Actually Happened:**\n",
    "- **1781**: William Herschel discovers Uranus, the first planet found with a telescope\n",
    "- **1821-1845**: Astronomers notice Uranus isn't following its predicted path\n",
    "- **1845**: Two brilliant mathematicians, **Urbain Le Verrier** (France) and **John Couch Adams** (England), independently calculate where an unknown planet should be\n",
    "- **September 23, 1846**: German astronomer **Johann Galle** points his telescope at Le Verrier's predicted location and finds Neptune within 1° of the prediction!\n\n",
    "This was one of the greatest triumphs of mathematical physics - discovering a planet using only math and Newton's laws!\n\n",
    "---\n\n",
    "## **What You'll Learn Today**\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you'll understand:\n",
    "1. How to detect hidden patterns in data using **Fourier Analysis**\n",
    "2. How **Kepler's Third Law** connects orbital periods to distances\n",
    "3. How **Newton's Law of Gravitation** explains planetary motion\n",
    "4. How mathematical analysis can predict the existence of unseen objects\n\n",
    "---\n\n",
    "## **Key Physics Concepts We'll Use**\n\n",
    "### **🔭 Kepler's Third Law (The Harmony of the Spheres)**\n",
    "Johannes Kepler discovered that there's a beautiful mathematical relationship between how long a planet takes to orbit the Sun and how far it is from the Sun:\n\n",
    "**The Law:** *The square of a planet's orbital period is proportional to the cube of its average distance from the Sun*\n\n",
    "**Mathematical Formula:** $$T^2 \\propto a^3$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**In practical units:** $$\\left(\\frac{T}{T_{Earth}}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{a}{1 \\text{ AU}}\\right)^3$$\n\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- T = orbital period (time for one complete orbit)\n",
    "- a = semi-major axis (average distance from Sun)\n",
    "- AU = Astronomical Unit (Earth-Sun distance ≈ 150 million km)\n\n",
    "**Why This Works:** Planets farther from the Sun move slower and have longer paths to travel, so they take much longer to complete an orbit.\n\n",
    "### **🍎 Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation**\n",
    "Isaac Newton realized that the same force that makes apples fall also keeps planets in orbit:\n\n",
    "**The Law:** *Every object in the universe attracts every other object with a force proportional to their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them*\n\n",
    "**Mathematical Formula:** $$F = G\\frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}$$\n\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- F = gravitational force between two objects\n",
    "- G = gravitational constant (6.67 × 10⁻¹¹ m³/kg·s²)\n",
    "- m₁, m₂ = masses of the two objects\n",
    "- r = distance between the centers of the objects\n\n",
    "**Key Insight:** If a third object (like Neptune) is near two others (Sun and Uranus), it will gravitationally \"tug\" on them, causing small deviations in their orbits.\n\n",
    "### **📊 Fourier Transform (Finding Hidden Rhythms)**\n",
    "Imagine you're listening to a complex piece of music and want to identify all the individual notes being played. A Fourier Transform does exactly this for data - it breaks down complex, messy signals into simple, periodic components.\n\n",
    "**What it does:** Converts data from the \"time domain\" (what happens when) to the \"frequency domain\" (what repeats how often)\n\n",
    "**In our case:** Takes Uranus's position deviations over time and reveals the hidden periodic \"tug\" from Neptune\n\n",
    "**The Math:** The Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) finds patterns by looking for correlations with sine and cosine waves of different frequencies\n\n",
